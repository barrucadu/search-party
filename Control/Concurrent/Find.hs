-- | A value of type @Find m a@ represents a concurrent search
-- computation (happening in the 'MonadConc' monad @m@) which may
-- produce a value of type @a@, or fail. If a value can be returned,
-- one will be (although it's nondeterministic which one will actually
-- be returned). Usually you will be working with values of type @Find
-- IO a@, but the generality allows for testing.
--
-- You should prefer using the 'Applicative' instance over the 'Monad'
-- instance if you can, as the 'Applicative' preserves parallelism.
